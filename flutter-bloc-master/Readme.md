## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. When it comes to designing a mobile application, there are countless design patterns that we can follow. [Bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/) is one of the very few library/arch which provides predictable state management in flutter
The goal of Bloc library is to make it easy to separate presentation from business logic, facilitating testability and reusability.
This repository mainly focuses on the projects which use bloc design pattern and intend to help out the bloc users and beginners as well.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)
